Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your Crystal Method on
You were like, tall, tan, drivin' 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like, "You're so pretty"
"Springsteen is the king, don't you think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin's so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh
