[action] me hard before you go
Summertime [feeling]
I just wanted you to know
That, [person], you're the best

I got my red [thing] on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my [physical feature] up real big beauty queen style
[clothing] off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are [adjective] like a snare
Honey, I'm on [metaphorical feeling], I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
